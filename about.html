    <div class="para">
        <p>          The state of Assam is prone to yearly flooding because of its tropical monsoon environment. 
            Although the monsoons are crucial for the region's economy, which is heavily based on agriculture, 
            they now often bring harm to infrastructure, crops, livelihoods, and even fatalities. Daily rainfall data 
            indicates a rise in severe rainfall events, which has resulted in significant floods in Assam despite a decline 
            in yearly precipitation.  The effects of climate change have been linked to greater regional rainfall variability 
            in both time and space.</p>

    <div class="para" id="data">
        <p>
            The data indicates that over 50 lakh people across 32 districts in Assam were affected by the floods in every year.
