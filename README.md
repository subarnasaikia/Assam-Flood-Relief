### Inspiration

The state of Assam is prone to yearly flooding because of its tropical monsoon environment. Although the monsoons are crucial for the region's economy, which is heavily based on agriculture, they now often bring harm to infrastructure, crops, livelihoods, and even fatalities. Daily rainfall data indicates a rise in severe rainfall events, which has resulted in significant floods in Assam despite a decline in yearly precipitation.  The effects of climate change have been linked to greater regional rainfall variability in both time and space.
 
 According to the data, flood in assam impacted over 50 lakh people acrose 32 district.
 
 
 ### What it does
 
I built a website where flood victims may use the google map api to identify the closest flood relief camp. People with a big heart can donate food and money to CM's Relief Fund by using the website.

People can also discover emergency numbers on our page and contact us to request financial aid.
